## About this dataset

The data are from an intercollegiate quiz tournament which took place at several locations in the USA, one location in Canada, and one in the UK.

* format similar to University Challenge
* here focus on buzzer questions - how quickly they are answered correctly
* bouncebacks occur when the other team already buzzed incorrectly - they can be included or not in this app
* the boxplots show the distributions of the "times" the questions were correctly answered
* times are based on the number of words that had been read as a proportion of the total number of words in the question.
* the table represents the data shown in the boxplots in tabular form
* the barchart shows what percentage of the answers given were correct, for each subcategory
* the freqbar shows the number of unique questions that were asked in each category
* the information could potentially be used to decide which topics to focus on.
